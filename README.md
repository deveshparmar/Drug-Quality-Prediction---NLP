# Drug-Quality-Prediction-NLP
- Drug Quality Prediction using NLP is a natural language processing (NLP) based technique to predict the quality of pharmaceutical drugs. It involves analyzing textual data such as drug descriptions, reviews, and side effects, to determine the efficacy and safety of a drug.

- The process typically involves several steps, such as data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. In the data collection step, relevant drug-related information is gathered from various sources such as drugs.com, drug databases etc. The collected data is then preprocessed to remove noise, standardize the text, and create a corpus of words.

- In the feature extraction step, various techniques such as TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), Count Vectorizer and word embeddings are used to transform the textual data into numerical features. These features are then fed into a machine learning algorithm such as support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and naive bayes to build a predictive model.

- An accuracy of 94% is achieved with random forest classifier

- The trained model can then be used to classify the quality of new drugs based on their textual description. This approach can be particularly useful in the early stages of drug development, where it can help identify potential issues with a drug before it goes through expensive and time-consuming clinical trials.
